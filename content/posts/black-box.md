## SOP

1. Gather the necessary materials and equipment:
    *   3/8" plywood or 1/4" louan sheets
    *   Aerosol traffic black paint
    *   Plywood or similar material for creating frames
    *   Chalk or temporary marking tool
    *   Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, goggles, and a mask
2. Prepare the work area:
    *   Ensure you have a well-ventilated space or work outdoors.
    *   Set up a work table or area with sufficient space to accommodate the size and quantity of black boxes you need to create.
3. Build the frames:
    *   Using the plywood or similar material, construct frames to hold the black boxes.
    *   Cut the plywood to the desired dimensions for the black boxes, allowing for a border if desired.
4. Set up the frames:
    *   Place the frames on the work table or area, ensuring they are stable and secure.
    *   Arrange them in a manner that allows for efficient painting and easy movement.
5. Chalk the desired locations for the black boxes:
    *   Use chalk or a temporary marking tool to mark the positions where the black boxes will be painted.
    *   Ensure the markings are accurate and aligned with the desired dimensions.
6. Prepare the aerosol traffic black paint:
    *   Shake the paint can thoroughly to ensure proper mixing.
7. Put on the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE):
    *   Wear gloves, goggles, and a mask to protect yourself from paint fumes and potential splatters.
8. Apply the black background:
    *   Holding the aerosol traffic black paint can at the recommended distance, spray an even coat of paint within each marked location, filling the area for the black box.
    *   Maintain a steady and controlled motion to ensure uniform coverage.
    *   Apply multiple thin coats if necessary, allowing each coat to dry before applying the next.
9. Allow the paint to dry:
    *   Follow the drying time recommended by the paint manufacturer.
    *   Ensure the black boxes are completely dry before handling or moving them.
10. Conduct a final inspection:
    *   Inspect each black box for uniformity, coverage, and overall quality.
    *   Make any necessary touch-ups or corrections if required.
11. Clean up and dispose of waste:
    *   Dispose of any leftover paint and cleaning materials properly according to local regulations.
    *   Clean any paint spills or splatters on the work area or surrounding surfaces.

By following this SOP, you can efficiently create black box backgrounds, providing a solid base for further stenciling or markings in parking lots or other applications.
