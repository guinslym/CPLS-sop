**Painting the Circle:**

*   Position the machine at the starting point of the circle’s circumference.
*   Align the back of the machine (where the paint gun is located) with the chalk line.
*   Ensure the machine is level and stable.

**Operating the Machine:**

*   Start the machine and engage the paint gun.
*   Begin moving the machine forward, following the chalk line carefully.
*   Maintain a steady speed to ensure an even application of paint.
*   Continuously check the alignment of the paint gun with the chalk line.
*   If necessary, make small adjustments to the machine’s position to stay on the line.

**Completing the Circle:**

*   Continue painting until the starting point is reached.
*   Stop the paint gun and turn off the machine.
*   Inspect the painted circle for any gaps or uneven areas.
*   Touch up any missed spots with a handheld spray can or brush if necessary.

**Cleanup:**

*   Clean the paint gun and machine thoroughly according to the manufacturer's instructions.
*   Dispose of any leftover paint and cleaning materials properly.
*   Store the machine and materials in a safe, dry place.

**Safety and Final Checks:**

*   Ensure the painted area is cordoned off until the paint is completely dry.
*   Verify the circle is evenly painted and meets the required specifications.
*   Document the completion of the task and any issues encountered for future reference.
